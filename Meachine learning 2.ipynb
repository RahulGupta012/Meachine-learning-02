    "Overfitting and underfitting both are the imperfections of a model. In the overfitting the accuracy of tarining of the model is high but in respect of that accuracay the testing model accuracay is low. It means the model has been biased with that specific dataset, which is used for giving training to the model.when we use a new data set for testing model, it gives low accuracy. Such kind of situation called overfitting in meachine learning.In this situation the bais of model is low and verience is high.\n",

In such a case training of the model has very low accuracay. and it is very obvious that the accuracy of test model should also be low for that.So it is also a fault of a system that has very low accuracy for giving the right output to the user."
